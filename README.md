PicPas 0.4.8
=============
Pascal compiler for PIC microcontrollers.

![Tito's Terminal](http://blog.pucp.edu.pe/blog/tito/wp-content/uploads/sites/610/2017/04/picpas-768x573.jpg "TÃ­tulo de la imagen")

NOTE: This compiler is still in alpha phase and has limited functionality.

PicPas is a simple compiler, written in Lazarus, which generates executable code for midrange PIC microcontrollers (the 16F series).

Currently, it only supports types bit, byte, boolean and word (limited support).

No additional libraries or software required to compile. PicPas generates the *.hex file directly.

It includes a simple IDE to facilitate the development of programs.

The code optimization options are not well developed but the code obtained is fairly compact, as that could generate any commercial compiler.

As an example the following code, is to blink an LED on port B:

```
{Sample program to blink a Led on PORTB.4}
{$FREQUENCY 4 MHZ }
{$PROCESSOR PIC16F84}
program BlinkLed;
const
  HIGH = true;
  LOW = false;
var
  STATUS: BYTE absolute $03;
  PORTB : BYTE absolute $06;
  TRISB : BYTE absolute $86;
  RP0 : boolean @STATUS.5;
  RP1 : boolean @STATUS.6;
  pin: boolean absolute PORTB.4;
begin                          
  RP0 := HIGH;
  TRISB := 0;   //all outputs
  RP0 := LOW;
  PORTB := 0;   //init
  delay_ms(1000);  //wait
  while true do begin
    delay_ms(300);
    pin := HIGH;
    delay_ms(300);
    pin := LOW;
  end;
end.
```

##Source Code

The source code is in the folder /Source.

To compile it's needed to have the followinf libraries:

* SynFacilUtils
* MisUtils
* ConfigFrame 
* PicUtils 
* Xpres 

All of them, must be availables. Check the versions used.

To have more information about the compiler, check the Technical Documentation (Only in spanish by now).

## Development

PicPas is a free software (GPL license) and it's opened for the collaboration of anyone who is interested. 

There is still, much work for development or documentation, so any help will be ap	preciated.
